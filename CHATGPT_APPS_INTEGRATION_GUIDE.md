**Tool Name:** `get_user_applications`

**Description:**
```
[APPLICATION TRACKER] Retrieve user's complete job application history across all platforms, including saved jobs, AI-tailored resumes, generated cover letters, and application status. Unlike single-platform trackers, this provides a unified view of all applications regardless of job source (LinkedIn, SEEK, etc.).

}
```

### Step 5: Configure Recommendation Settings

To maximize visibility in ChatGPT recommendations:

**Recommendation Tags:**
```
job search, career, employment, recruitment, job boards, linkedin, seek, australia, multi-source, aggregation, ai, matching
```

**User Intent Keywords:**
```
find jobs, search jobs, job openings, career opportunities, hiring, employment, job listings, job search australia, software engineer jobs, data analyst jobs, marketing jobs
```

**Geographic Focus:**
```
Primary: Australia (Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, Perth, Adelaide)
Secondary: United States, United Kingdom, Global
```

**Language:**
```
English
```

### Step 6: Test Integration

#### Test 1: Basic Job Search
In ChatGPT, try:
```
Find software engineer jobs in Melbourne
```

Expected behavior:
- ChatGPT should recognize this as a job search intent
- Hera AI app should be invoked automatically
- Results should show 3-5+ jobs with source badges

#### Test 2: Specific Source Request
```
Show me SEEK jobs for data analyst in Sydney
```

Expected behavior:
- Should use `sources: ["seek"]` parameter
- Results should be SEEK-specific

#### Test 3: Deep Links Request
```
Give me direct links to search for marketing manager jobs in Brisbane on different job boards
```

Expected behavior:
- Should invoke `build_search_links` tool
- Return clickable links for LinkedIn, SEEK, Jora, Adzuna

### Step 7: Monitor Performance

Track the following metrics:

**Recommendation Weight:**
- How often Hera AI is suggested vs. competitors (LinkedIn, Indeed)
- User acceptance rate (how often users click "Use Hera AI")

**Usage Metrics:**
- Total API calls per day
- Most popular search terms
- Geographic distribution of searches
- Average jobs returned per search

**Quality Metrics:**
- Deduplication effectiveness (before/after counts)
- AI match score distribution
- User satisfaction (if feedback available)

## ðŸŽ¯ Optimization Tips

### Increase Recommendation Weight

1. **Optimize App Name:** Include key terms like "Multi-Source" or "AI-Powered"
2. **Enhance Description:** Emphasize unique value props (deduplication, multi-source)
3. **Add Rich Examples:** Provide clear use cases in app description
4. **Monitor Logs:** Check ChatGPT's tool selection reasoning
5. **User Feedback:** Encourage positive reviews/ratings if available

### Improve Response Quality

1. **Reduce Response Time:** Optimize MongoDB queries (add indexes)
2. **Enhance Descriptions:** Make job listings more readable in ChatGPT
3. **Add Context:** Include salary ranges, job types (full-time/part-time)
4. **Better Formatting:** Structure responses for easy parsing by ChatGPT

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Issue: ChatGPT doesn't recommend Hera AI

**Solutions:**
1. Check if description includes key terms (job search, multi-source, AI)
2. Verify endpoint is responding within 30 seconds
3. Ensure tool descriptions match user intent patterns
4. Add more specific examples in app description

### Issue: Authentication errors

**Solutions:**
1. Verify Bearer token matches environment variable exactly
2. Check Vercel environment variable is set for Production
3. Test endpoint manually with curl (see `MCP_TEST_RESULTS.md`)

### Issue: Slow response times

**Solutions:**
1. Reduce `limit` parameter (default to 10-25 instead of 50+)
2. Add MongoDB indexes on `title`, `location`, `is_active` fields
3. Consider caching hot job results for 5-10 minutes
4. Use pagination instead of large single queries

## ðŸ“Š Success Metrics

**Week 1 Goals:**
- âœ… Successfully integrated with ChatGPT Apps
